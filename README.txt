Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php

In this refactored version, I made the following changes:

->Removed unnecessary comments.
->Adjusted indentation and formatting for better readability.
->Removed the unused $adminSenderEmail variable.
->Simplified the condition for checking if distance and time values exist in the distanceFeed method.
->Replaced the array_except function with the except method to exclude specific keys in the update method.
->Removed redundant variable assignments in the distanceFeed method.
->Updated the return statements to return responses directly.
->Removed unnecessary comments.
->Applied consistent spacing and line breaks for better code organization.

Here's an explanation of what's happening in the refactored code:

->The index method handles the logic for retrieving jobs. It checks if a user_id is provided in the request. If so, it calls the getUsersJobs method of the $repository to get the jobs associated with that user. Otherwise, if the authenticated user is an admin or superadmin, it calls the getAll method of the $repository to retrieve all jobs. The response is then returned.

->The show method retrieves a specific job by its ID using the $repository. It also includes the related translator and user data. The job is then returned as a response.

->The store method handles the creation of a new job. It retrieves the request data, calls the store method of the $repository, passing the authenticated user and the data. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The update method updates an existing job. It retrieves the request data and authenticated user. It then calls the updateJob method of the $repository, passing the job ID, the data (excluding _token and submit fields), and the authenticated user. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The immediateJobEmail method handles the sending of an immediate job email. It retrieves the request data and calls the storeJobEmail method of the $repository, passing the data. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The getHistory method retrieves the job history for a specific user. If a user_id is provided in the request, it calls the getUsersJobsHistory method of the $repository, passing the user ID and the request. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The acceptJob method handles accepting a job. It retrieves the request data and authenticated user. It then calls the acceptJob method of the $repository, passing the data and the user. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The acceptJobWithId method handles accepting a job by its ID. It retrieves the job ID from the request and the authenticated user. It then calls the acceptJobWithId method of the $repository, passing the job ID and the user. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The cancelJob method handles canceling a job. It retrieves the request data and authenticated user. It then calls the cancelJobAjax method of the $repository, passing the data and the user. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The endJob method handles ending a job. It retrieves the request data and calls the endJob method of the $repository, passing the data. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The customerNotCall method handles the case when a customer doesn't call. It retrieves the request data and calls the customerNotCall method of the $repository, passing the data. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The getPotentialJobs method retrieves potential jobs for the authenticated user. It retrieves the user from the request and calls the getPotentialJobs method of the $repository, passing the user. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The distanceFeed method handles updating the distance, time, and other details of a job. It retrieves the request data, including distance, time, job ID, session time, flagged status, manually handled status, and admin comments. It then updates the Distance model and the Job model with the provided data. The method returns a response indicating that the record has been updated.

->The reopen method handles reopening a job. It retrieves the request data and calls the reopen method of the $repository, passing the data. The response from the repository is returned as a response.

->The resendNotifications method handles resending push notifications for a job. It retrieves the request data, including the job ID. It then retrieves the job from the $repository, converts it to data using the jobToData method, and sends push notifications to the translators using the sendNotificationTranslator method of the $repository. The method returns a success response.

->The resendSMSNotifications method handles resending SMS notifications for a job. It retrieves the request data, including the job ID. It then retrieves the job from the $repository, converts it to data using the jobToData method, and sends SMS notifications to the translators using the sendSMSNotificationToTranslator method of the $repository. If an exception occurs during the process, an error response is returned.

->These methods handle various operations related to job management, including retrieval, creation, update, acceptance, cancellation, and notification sending.




----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!
